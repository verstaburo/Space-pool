        h4 Guests and the role of the Applications
        ol
          li The Applications brings together a range of Hosts who may create listings for their Office Space (Listings). The Listing will be publicly available via the Applications. Each Listing includes details of the Host, location, facilities, price, deposit amount, cancelation policy, the minimum /maximum time periods, and whether the contract term will auto-renew and the length of the auto-renew of which each Office Space is available to the Guest.  Under no circumstances will we be the Host or landlord or provider of any Office Space and you shall not consider us to be such.  We have no interest in any Office Space and have no obligation to provide you with the Office Space or liability in connection with the same.
          li The relevant contact details of the Host will be made available through the Applications and we would recommend that you visit any Office Space prior to making an offer or entering into a contract or making any payments in connection with any Office Space.
          li When you contract to use any Office Space, you will contract directly from the relevant Host (not from us).  All contracts in respect of the Office Space must be signed between you and the Host directly.  We will never sign contracts on your or any Host's behalf and we will not be a party to any such contract.  All contracts should be signed using the signing mechanism available in the Applications.
          li The relevant Host will be responsible for the terms of the contract, the provision of the Office Space, services available (or not) within that Office Space, and any concerns or complaints you may have about the Office Space.  All questions and concerns you have in connection with the Office Space and your contracting for or use of should be directed to the Host and not to us.
          li Our role is limited to acting as commercial agent to collect your payments on behalf of that Host. Our receipt of full payment from you will discharge your debt to the relevant Host in respect of that payment. Though we may assist with certain practical issues on behalf of the relevant Host, we do not have any contractual obligations to you and you do not have any contractual rights against us regarding any Office Space used by you.
          li If you wish to terminate your contract with your Host you can give notice, in accordance with the terms of you contract with your Host, to your Host through the Applications.
          li If a Guest agrees with the Host to terminate its contract with the Host for the Office Space before notice period expires, then the Guest must, inform Spacepool that the contract is being terminated early by email to hello@spacepool.com . If it is agreed that the term of the contract is to terminate early then the Guest shall pay Spacepool the fee of 10% of the fees which would have been payable by the Guest for the unexpired term of notice period.  Spacepool will provide to the Guest details of the amount payable.
      li
        h4 Hosts

          li The Host understands and agrees that the placement and rankings of Listings in search results may depend on various factors include Guests shortlists and/or preferences.
          li Spacepool shall require the Host to provide certain terms in its contract with the Guest.  These will include that the contract term with the Guest will auto-renew and that any notice period shall run from the first day of the month following the month in which termination notice was given.  Spacepool reserves the right to require additional terms to be included in a contract and to refuse to allow a Host to upload Listings.
          li The Host may request assistance from Spacepool in respect of a Listing (for example taking of photographs or preparing a description of the Office Space), such assistance will be provided at Spacepoolâ€™s discretion and may incur a fee. The Host warrants and represents that it shall promptly authorise any and all material amendments prepared by Spacepool in respect of a Listing which may occur by (a) way of written authorisation; or (b) the Host's completion of the Listing for public viewing and thereby publishing the Listing on the Applications (whichever is the earlier act).
          li The Host acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for all Listings it creates and represents and warrants that

                  li has the right, authority or permission from the owner of the Office Space to list such Office Space and is the duly authorized agent or representative of such Property Owner for the purpose of engaging in the Licence of such Office Space in accordance with these Terms of Business; and
              li the Office Space is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;
              li making the Office Space available and the use by any Guest will not breach any agreement with any third party including any lease or sublease;
              li any contractual discussions or negotiations between the Host and the Guest shall be the sole responsibility of the Host and Guest;
              li it shall keep Spacepool informed of the current status of the Listing and (i) remove the Listing; or (ii) advise Spacepool in writing, if the Office Space is licensed to a third party excluding a Guest.
          li The Host acknowledges and agrees that Spacepool shall be entitled to the Spacepool Fee (defined in clause 5.4 below) if it the Guest makes contact with the Host through the Applications even if the Host and Guest do not complete the contract between them through the Applications but do so personally excluding the Applications.  Spacepool reserves the right to seek evidence of occupation of the Office Space by the Guest and increase the Spacepool Fees payable to 15% for the entire contract length or 12 months whichever is the shorter and such fees shall be immediately payable upfront.
          li The Host shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Spacepool against all losses that Spacepool incurs or suffers however arising as a result of or in connection with:

              li any claim made by a Guest or any third party arising out of or in connection with the provision of the Office Space, to the extent that such claim arises as a result of any breach of these Terms by, or the negligence of, the Hosts or its personnel; and/or
              li any claim made by an owner of any property arising out of or in connection with any Listing or contract or arrangement entered into with any Guest.
          li Spacepool recommends that the Host obtains appropriate insurance for all Office Spaces and encourages it to carefully review any existing insurance policy to determine whether such policy will cover the actions or omissions of the Guest and its invitees. It is important that the Host understands any exclusions and deductibles that may apply to its insurance policy and ensure that the granting of or access to any Office Space to a Guest does not invalidate the terms of its insurance policy.
          li The Host agrees that, by submitting any Listing, you grant us and our affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sub-licensable right and licence to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display the Listing (in whole or part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology, for marketing purposes.
          li As a Host, you understand and agree that Spacepool does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent.
          li The Host agrees that we can collect payments on your behalf and you appoint us as your agent to invoice and collect payments due to you from your Guests.
      li
        h4 Fees and Payment
        ol
          li The fees of the relevant Office Space are as quoted on the Applications and then subsequently agreed with the Host. We will be notified by the Host of the fees agreed between the Guest and the Host. This notification will be final.  We will not agree this figure with a Guest. If the Guest considers that the figure provided by the Host is wrong, this matter must be resolved directly with the Host.
          li The fees payable for the Office Space may during the term of your occupation or use change as agreed with the Host.
          li If a Guest pays a Host a deposit in respect of the Guest's use of the Office Space, that deposit will be held by our third party payment partner.  The third party payment provider will hold the deposit until or unless there is a claim by the Host or it is returned to the Guest.  The deposit shall not accrue interest while held by Spacepool and no interest will be payable in respect of the same.  Within two (2) weeks of the end of the Guest's use of the Office Space, the Host must email hello@spacepool.com to confirm to Spacepool whether it wishes to make a claim for damages against the deposit.  If the Host wishes to make a claim it must, for its records, send pictures and details of the damage to Spacepool.  The Host and not Spacepool must agree with the Guest the amount that will be payable from the deposit.  Spacepool will not release any deposit to the Host unless the Guest has confirmed to Spacepool in writing that it agrees with the assessment of damages made by the Host.  Once agreed the claimed damages will be released to the Host and the remainder (if any) will be released to the Guest.  If the Host confirms to Spacepool that it does not wish to make a claim against the deposit or has not contacted Spacepool within four weeks of the Guest moving out of the Office Space, Spacepool shall be entitled to return the deposit in full to the Guest.
          li We will not charge the Guest any payment for using the Application or making any payments through our Applications.  In respect of each payment made by a Guest to the Host we will deduct the fees as set out on our fees schedule ("Spacepool Fee"), the remainder of the payment made by the Guest will be paid to the Host.  The Spacepool Fee shall only be payable by the Host for the term of the contract or 12 months whichever is the shorter.
