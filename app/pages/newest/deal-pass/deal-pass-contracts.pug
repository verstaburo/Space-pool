              p Payment agreements are used in business relationships when one party agrees to pay another. Freelancers and independent contractors often use payment agreements with their clients to ensure that they will be paid fairly and on time. Many payment agreements also fall under other categories, such as service agreements. A car rental agreement is a type of payment agreement. Car rental agreements likely will cover insurance information, contain a description of the vehicle and its registration information, list the odometer reading, and note any existing wear and tear so the renter is not liable. A vendor agreement is another type of payment agreement used when a vendor at a fair or market must enter into an agreement with the hosting party. In a vendor agreement, the vendor may pay for their space up-front, but then keep any profits from the event, or may agree to pay a commission of their profits to the host. These agreements cover payments, but also line up terms and conditions of what is expected of both parties.
